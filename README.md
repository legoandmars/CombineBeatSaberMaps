# ðŸ”§Usage

To use this program, put the folders of the beatmaps you wish to merge in the Beatmaps folder. Run run.bat and the data of all the beatmaps will be merged into CombinedMap.

Note: CombinedMap still requires an audio file to be made. If you want to merge the audio files of the maps you're combining, drag the audio files of all the maps you're merging into audacity. Once you've dragged all the audio files in, export it as song.ogg (make sure to rename it to song.egg after it's exported)
